# Stage 1. Corpus Creation

For the purposes of this study, it was necessary to build a corpus of contemporary science fiction works. For the retrieval of contemporary works, the best resource was the HathiTrust collection.

In order to best represent the whole genre, I selected books that were nominated for prizes awarded to science fiction books. Specifically, I selected the winners and nominees of the Nebula, the Hugo and the Retro-Hugo awards.

In order to fill in the decades preceding the appearance of these two prizes (the Hugo was first awarded in 1953 and the Nebula only in 1966), I relied on Ted Underwoodâ€™s short metadata for his analysis of genres in his book Distant Horizons. Such data included science fiction works from the beginning of the century up to the 40s.

The code for extracting the metadata from wikipedia is available in [corpus_metadata_extraction.ipynb](https://github.com/federicabologna/thesis_space_scifi/blob/master/1_corpus/corpus_metadata_extraction.ipynb). The complete metadata is available in [metadata_with_htids.csv](https://github.com/federicabologna/thesis_space_scifi/blob/master/1_corpus/metadata_with_htids.csv)
