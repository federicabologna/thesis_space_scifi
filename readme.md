# A computational approach to urban space in science fiction

Github repository for my MA's thesis project. The scope of this study was to analyze the presence of urban space in North-American 20th century science fiction literature using computational methods.

This study was based on Edward Soja’s theory of space and Gabriel Zoran’s, Ruth Ronen’s and Dennis Yi Tenen’s studies on the construction of space in text. This research focused on Soja's Firstspace, the empirical and material aspects of space in text.

Cityspace was treated as: a literary topic; as the occurrence of linguistic units that shape urban areas in text; as the occurrence of geographical location in text. The first aspect was investigated using topic modeling; the second analyzing the occurrences of urban terms from a statistical perspective; the third analyzing the occurrences of named places.

1. Corpus creation
2. Topic modeling
3. Urban terms
4. Geographical locations
